# **Walmart Sales Forecasting Project**

This repository contains the necessary files and resources for the Walmart Sales Forecasting Project. The primary objective of this project is to analyze Walmart's sales data and develop a predictive model to forecast future sales, identify trends, and provide actionable insights to improve inventory management and operational efficiency.

## **Problem Statement**

### **[Problem Statement](https://github.com/KunalGarodi/Walmart-Sales-Forecasting-Project/blob/main/Problem%20Statement/Capstone%20Project%20(Walmart).pdf): Inventory and Sales Management Issues**

A retail store with multiple outlets across the country is facing challenges in managing its inventory to match the demand and supply accurately. The objective of this project is to analyze the weekly sales data and forecast future sales to help Walmart improve its inventory management.

---

### **Analysis Objectives**

The following analyses have been performed on the provided weekly sales data:

1. **Statistical Analysis & EDA**:  
   - Analyzed if weekly sales are influenced by the unemployment rate, identifying which stores are most affected.
   - Detected seasonal trends in sales and identified possible reasons for seasonality.
   - Examined the relationship between temperature and weekly sales to assess any correlations.
   - Investigated the impact of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on sales performance across different stores.
   - Identified top-performing stores based on historical sales data.
   - Highlighted the worst-performing store and quantified the gap between the best and worst performers.

2. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Developed sales forecasting models using machine learning techniques to predict sales for each store for the next 12 weeks.

## **Project Objectives**

1. **Analyze the influence of macroeconomic factors** (unemployment rate, CPI, temperature) on weekly sales.
2. **Identify seasonal patterns** in sales to help Walmart optimize inventory during peak periods.
3. **Forecast future sales** for the next 12 weeks for each Walmart store to assist in better inventory management.
4. **Pinpoint top-performing stores** and understand what drives their performance.
5. **Identify underperforming stores** and assess the gap between the highest and lowest performers to make informed business decisions.

## **Tools and Technologies**

- **Python**: Employed for data cleaning, analysis, and building predictive models using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations to support exploratory data analysis.
- **Statsmodels**: Used for implementing ARIMA and other time-series models for forecasting.
- **DateTime**: Used for handling date-related operations for time-series data.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for handling time-indexed data and applying moving averages for forecasting.
- **Word**: Used to document and summarize the project findings in a report.
